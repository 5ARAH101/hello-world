# hello-world
This is just me trying to figure out how to use GitHub. Nothing to see here!

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.
Open your eyes, look up to the sky and seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy.
Cause I'm easy come, easy go, ittle high, little low.
Anyway the wind blows doesn't really matter to meeeeeeee.
Toooooo  meeeeeee.

(Instrumental)
