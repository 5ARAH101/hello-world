# hello-world
This is just me trying to figure out how to use GitHub. Nothing to see here!

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality.
Open your eyes, look up to the sky and seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy.
Cause I'm easy come, easy go, ittle high, little low.
Anyway the wind blows doesn't really matter to meeeeeeee.
Toooooo  meeeeeee.

(Instrumental)

Mama just killed a man.
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he's dead.
Mama, life has just begun.
But now I've gone and thrown it away.
Mama, ooh woo ooh. (ding ding)
Didn't mean to make you cry.
If I'm not back again this time tommorrow, carry on, carry on as if nothing even mattered.

(Instrumental)
